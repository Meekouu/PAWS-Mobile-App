# PAWS-Mobile App

A new Flutter project.


The Pet Analytics and Wellness System (PAWS) is an online system that aims to improve the business efficiency of Bath and Bark Veterinary Clinic through centralized data management, real-time tracking, and artificial intelligence-based analysis. The project solves some key shortcomings in the existing workflow of the clinic, such as disjointed medical records, laborious management of data, and poor resource planning.

The system has three key components: a mobile app for owners to input structured symptom and vaccination data, a web-based dashboard for veterinary staff and practice managers to chart metrics and track trends, and a machine learning-powered forecasting engine. In this documentation, the mobile app for PAWS will be showcased.

In the development of this Project, tools such as Flutter for mobile app development and Firebase for backend database storage.
